The fitnesse-rc project is a revision control plugin for the FitNesse acceptance testing framework. This allows
FitNesse test pages to be managed in a revision control system.

The plugin currently includes support for Subversion. Support for other revision control systems can be implemented
and contributed to this project. 

Building
--------
To use the fitnesse-rc plugin, first download the source and build using Ant. Before compiling, you must put a
fitnesse.jar file into the lib directory. The build_distribution target in the build.xml file will generate a
fitnesse-rc.jar file and will also copy dependent jar files into a dist directory (e.g. svknit.jar for Subversion).

Running
-------
Include the generated fitnesse-rc.jar and dependent jar files in the classpath for FitNesse in the startup script.

The revision control plugin is enabled using the plugin.properties file, which is usually in the root directory of the
FitNesse installation. Edit the plugin.properties file and add a value to the "Plugins" property:

   Plugins=fitnesse.revisioncontrol.RevisionControlPlugin

The revision control plugin requires one revision controller to be specified, to integrate with the specific revision
control system. For Subversion integration, add this line to plugins.properties:

   RevisionController=fitnesse.revisioncontrol.svn.SVNRevisionController

After adding the necessary jar files to the classpath and modifying plugins.properies, start FitNesse as usual. The
"Versions" action button on each page should be replaced by a "Revisions" button. Clicking the "Revisions" button on a
page invokes a responder with the availalble revision control actions for the page. The actions available depend on
the revision control system and the current state of the page (new / not under revision control, already under revision
control, modified locally, etc.).
